# Capstone Project - Dog Classification App

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed.

Dog breed classification is challenging task due to the Low inter-class variation and High intra-class variation nature of dogs. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to overcome this challenging classification problem.
